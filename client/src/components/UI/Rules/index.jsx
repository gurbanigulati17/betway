      <strong>1. Cricket General :-</strong> If a ball is not bowled during a
      competition, series or match then all bets will be void except for those
      on any market that has been unconditionally determined (e.g. in the
      'Completed Match' market).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>2. Cricket General :-</strong> If a match is shortened by weather,
      all bets will be settled according to the official result (including for
      limited overs matches, the result determined by the Duckworth Lewis
      method).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>3. Cricket General :-</strong> In the event of a match being
      decided by a bowl-off or toss of the coin, all bets will be void except
      for those on markets that have been unconditionally determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>4. Cricket Test matches :-</strong> If a match starts but is later
      abandoned for any reason other than weather (which may include but is not
      limited to: dangerous or unplayable wicket or outfield; pitch vandalism;
      strike or boycott; crowd protests/violence; stadium damage; acts of
      terrorism; and acts of God), Betfair reserves the right to void all bets,
      except for those on markets that have been unconditionally determined.

      <strong>5. Cricket Test matches :-</strong> In case anyone is found using
      2 different IDs and logging in from same IP his winning in both accounts
      will be cancelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>6. Cricket Test matches :-</strong> If the match is not scheduled
      to be completed within five days after the original scheduled completion
      date, then all bets on markets for this event will be void, except for
      bets on any markets that have been unconditionally determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>7. Cricket Limited Over matches :-</strong> If a match is declared
      (No Result), bets will be void on all markets for the event except for
      those markets which have been unconditionally determined or where the
      minimum number of overs have been bowled as laid out in the market
      specific information.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>8. Cricket Limited Over matches :-</strong> In the event of a new

      bets that were placed after 30 minutes before the original scheduled start
      of play on the first day will be made void. This rule relates to all
      markets except those that have been unconditionally determined (e.g. in
      the win the toss and toss combination markets).

      1. If OurExchange does not suspend a market on time for the occurrence of
      a Material Event (as defined in Part B of these Rules and Regulations
      above), OurExchange reserves the right to void bets unfairly matched after
      the Material Event has occurred. Voiding of these bets may take place
      during the event or retrospectively once a game is completed.
    </p>

          3. For the avoidance of doubt, where a video assistant referee ruling
          results in the award of a Material Event (as defined in Part B of
          these Rules and Regulations above), such Material Event will be deemed
          to have occurred at the time at which the video assistant referee
          commences a review relating to such (ultimately awarded) Material
          Event. In such circumstances, bets matched prior to the time at which
          the video assistant referee commences a review will not be voided.

        4. If a match has not started (or if OurExchange believes that a match
        will not have started) by 23:59 (local time) on its scheduled start
        date, then all bets will be void unless OurExchange has knowledge that
        the match has been rescheduled to be played within three days of its
        original start date.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.&nbsp;If a match starts but is later abandoned or postponed and
        OurExchange believes that the match will not have been completed by
        23:59 (local time) on its scheduled start date, then all markets, with
        the exception of any unconditionally determined markets, will be void
        unless OurExchange has knowledge that the match has been rescheduled to
        be played within three days of its original start date. If OurExchange
        does have knowledge that the game will be played within three days and
        the game is played within three days, then all bets will stand except if
        the match is restarted from the beginning. If the match is restarted
        from the beginning then all bets matched before the market went in-play
        will stand, but any bets placed in-play will be void, except for any
        bets placed in-play on markets which have been unconditionally
        determined, which will stand.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.&nbsp;For Friendly matches, all bets apply to the full duration of
        play according to the match officials, plus any stoppage time. If a
        friendly match starts but is later abandoned or postponed and is not
        completed (i.e. the full duration of play according to match officials,
        plus any stoppage time) within three days of the scheduled start date,
        all bets will be void except for those on markets which have been
        unconditionally determined. In the case of ambiguity over the official
        result from match officials, the outcome will be determined by
        OurExchange (acting reasonably) using information from independent
        sources.
      </p>
      <p>
        7.&nbsp;If an official fixture lists different team details to those
        listed on the OurExchange website (for example, the team name, reserves,
        age group, gender, etc), then all bets matched on the affected markets
        will be void. In all other cases, bets will stand (including instances
        where a team name is listed without specifying the term 'XI' in the
        name). If an official fixture is shown on the OurExchange website under
        an incorrect competition name, then OurExchange reserves the right to
        void all bets matched on the affected markets.
      </p>
      <p>
        8.&nbsp;If a team is relegated from a league because, at the end of a
        season, it has finished within the relegation positions which are
        relevant to that league (i.e. usually any of the bottom three league
        positions), bets on that team to be relegated will be settled as winning
        bets. If a team is otherwise disqualified, thrown out or removed from a
        league (i.e. in circumstances other than those where it has finished the
        season within the relevant relegation positions): (i) if such team is
        disqualified, thrown out or removed from the league before the relevant
        season has started, all bets on the affected market will be void (and a
        new market will subsequently be loaded) and (ii) if such team is
        disqualified, thrown out or removed from the league after the relevant
        season has started (or a determination is made by the applicable
        governing body, during the season, that the team will be thrown out or
        removed from the league following the season’s conclusion), all bets on
        the affected team will be void. For the avoidance of doubt, if a points
        deduction is imposed on a team such that it finishes the season within
        the relegation places which are relevant to the applicable league, bets
        on that team to be relegated will be settled as winning bets.
      </p>
      <p>
        9.&nbsp;The relevant season will be deemed to have started once the
        first league game has been played. For the purposes of this rule,
        markets relating to individual matches will not be deemed to be affected
        markets.
      </p>
      <p>
        10. 'Shirt numbers' bets will refer to the shirt number allocated at the
        start of the match. 'Shirt numbers' bets will include own-goal scorers.
        Any player whose shirt bears no number will be allocated the number 12.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        11. In case anyone is found using 2 different IDs and logging in from
        same IP his winning in both accounts will be cancelled.
      </p>
      12.&nbsp;For 'time of first goal' bets (i.e. First Goal Odds markets), the
      first half is deemed to last 45 minutes, regardless of stoppage time. Also
      for these markets, please note that the (0 - 10 Minutes) selection covers
      the first 10 minutes of the match. In other words, it runs from 0:00 until
      just before the clock hits 10:00. The (11 – 20 Minutes) selection runs
      from 10:00 until just before the clock hits 20:00. The same principle
      applies to each of the other selections in this market.<p></p>
      <p>
        13.&nbsp;For 'top goalscorer' markets only the goals scored in the
        league or competition stated in the Market Information count. For
        example, if a player joins a club mid-season any goals scored in a
        different league will not count, however goals scored for a different
        club in the same league will count. Own goals will not count.
        <br />
        Soccer :- In markets which relate to the number of incidents to occur,
        such as 'number of corners', these will be determined on the basis of
        the number taken, rather than awarded.
      </p>
      <p>
        14.&nbsp;o For markets that relate to the number of bookings given, the
        number of corners taken, any goalscorer or the time of a particular
        goal, the result will be determined by OurExchange (acting reasonably)
        using information from independent sources. In such cases, if any new
        information comes into the public domain within 48 hours of settlement,
        then OurExchange shall (acting reasonably) determine either: (i) whether
        the market should be reinstated or resettled in light of this new
        information; or (ii) to wait for further information before deciding
        whether to reinstate or resettle the market. Except where OurExchange
        has announced that it is waiting for further information, any
        information that comes into the public domain more than 48 hours after a
        market has been settled shall not be considered by OurExchange
        (regardless of whether or not such information may have led to a
        different result).

      1. If a player or pairing retires or is disqualified in any match, the
      player or pairing progressing to the next round (or winning the tournament
      in the case of a final) will be deemed the winner. However if less than
      one set has been completed at the time of the retirement or
      disqualification then all bets relating to that individual match will be
      void.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. All bets relating to the number of occurrences of certain events within
      a tournament will be void if the tournament is reduced in length,
      postponed or cancelled, except for those on markets which have been
      unconditionally determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. All bets will stand regardless of changes to scheduled venues,
      including any changes to a different type of surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. If the scheduled duration of a match is reduced or increased in the
      number of games/sets required to win, all bets will be void except for
      those on markets which have been unconditionally determined. Please note
      that this does not apply to ‘Match Odds’ or ‘Set Winner’ markets on Davis
      Cup matches or ‘dead rubber’ matches that have been shortened from five
      sets to three sets after the market has been loaded, provided that the
      match has been shortened in accordance with the competition’s rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Where markets are offered on individual games or sets within a match, a
      retirement or disqualification during a game or set will render bets on
      that game or set market and all individual game or set markets void except
      those on markets which have been unconditionally determined.
